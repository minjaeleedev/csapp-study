# 1-1 Information Is Bits + Context

#### hello program

1. begins life as a source program(or source file)
   1. programmer creates wit han editor and saves in a text file called `hello.c`
   2. **source program** is a sequence of bits, each with a value of 0 or 1
   3. organized in 8-bit chunks(bytes)
2. ASCII standard
   1. represent each character with a unique byte size integer value
3. text files, binary files
   1. text files : consist exclusively of ASCII characters
   2. All other files : binary

#### bit and context

1. **Bits** : All information in a system is represented as a bunch of bits.

   1. disk files
   2. programs stored in memory
   3. user data stored in memory
   4. data transferred across a network

2. **Context**
   1. The only thing that distinguishes different data object is the context in which we view them.
   2. in different context, the same sequence of bytes might represent different data
   3. an integer, floating-point number, character string, or machine instruction, etc

#### Aside - Origins of the C programming language
